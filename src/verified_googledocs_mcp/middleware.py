"""Enforcement middleware: ensures every mutating tool returns evidence.

A mutating tool that returns a bare success without an evidence payload would
defeat the verified-write contract.  This middleware is the structural backstop:
it checks that the result of any registered mutating tool contains either an
``applied`` key (normal success or dry-run) or an ``error_code`` key (a
surfaced VerifyError).  If neither is present the middleware raises so the tool
cannot report bare success.

Non-mutating tools pass through untouched.

Registration
------------
Add a tool name to MUTATING_TOOLS when a new mutating tool is wired up.
